# AcademicApp

An open-source project that I am working on my free time to create an app for university students just to keep everything in place.

## Installation
To install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage



```bash
npm run start 
```
or 
```bash
npx expo start
```

It uses [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for its backend.
You would need to set up following env variables:

```env
FIREBASE_API_KEY=""
FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=""
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=""
FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=""
FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=""
FIREBASE_APP_ID=""
FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=""
```
